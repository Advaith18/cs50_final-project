        <p style = "text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 40px;">The given distros are very good to revive old PC's or for a PC where performance is key and it has to be very low on system resources.
            <br>All these distros aim to be resource efficient and fast. They are also very good to set up virtual machine's as they are low on resources.<br> They may not come with a lot of pre installed software but are very snappy. I would not suggest a new user to try any of these because you will have to install the packages manually.
            <br><br><br><br>These are the distro which are fast and usable : 
            <br><br><br>1. Linux Lite 
            <br><br>2. Lubuntu
            <br><br>3. Zorin OS lite

        <p style = "text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 30px;">
            Linux lite. For. Me it is the best Linux distro in terms of:
            <br><br>
            Lightness ( the name itself says that!), Performance/speed (blazing fast) Amazingly Beautiful UI even alongside less resource consumption (particularly Linux lite 4.2), Beginner friendly, Old /ancient desktop reviver
            <br>It uses a XFCE desktop environment by default with few changes which makes it power efficient as well as awesome looking.
