#### Description:
I have built a web app on flask a web framework on python which i have learnt from week 9's lecture. I built the database in sqlite and have connected the database to python using the cs50 library. I built this web app so that people are made aware that there are other operating system's other than macos and windows and that they are equally good enough. I have used some css and javascript to make the application more better looking and interactive. Most of the synatax i use is what i learnt from course's lectures. But i have used a few css attributes which i have learnt through research. I have made a github repository so that i cauld put my code in the cloud and installed WSL on my PC. I used VS code to design and render the application. I have answered a few question on the discord. I used the plasceholder "?" like David suggested to avoid SQL injection. I really enjoyed web development so i will also take the CS50W. I have watched briyan's tutorial on how to use github which has helped me in uploading my code in the cloud. Most of the code is in html. I have 11 html files, 1 css file, 1 js file, 1 app.py and 1 .db file. I have added an apology.html just like the finance pset in cs50x.
